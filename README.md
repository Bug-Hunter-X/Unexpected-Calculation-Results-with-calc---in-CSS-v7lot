This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically when combining percentages and other units. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.  The issue arises from the way `calc()` handles unit conversions and order of operations, leading to unexpected results. The solution involves careful consideration of unit types and restructuring the calculation.
